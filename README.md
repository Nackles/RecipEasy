## Description
Build my portfolio layout using the FireBase for our API Framework based RecipEasy.app. 


### Specifications
1. Inside  `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are friends)

     * eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content should take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens to have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on mobile device versus computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
